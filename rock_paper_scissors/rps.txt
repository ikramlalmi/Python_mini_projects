we will definetely be using random functions. we will also need some user input.
we will also make the computer choose because we are playing against it. we will use random.choice and give it a list to choose from.
once we know the computer choice and the user choice, we can come up with some rules to determine who wins.  
If the user and the computer have both the same choise, it is  tie.
The rules of the game are: r>s, s>p, p>r.
Define a helper function, is_win, that will return true if the user wins. it will be player vs opponent. and add the rules for when the user wins.
now call the function in the play function, passing the user input and the computeer choice as arg. so then ad the return, you lost is the is_win function returns false, you lost.
